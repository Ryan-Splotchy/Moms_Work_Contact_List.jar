# Moms_Work_Contact_List
A small fullstack contacts list application I made for my mom to use at work, she deals with a multitude of people passing through her office and using this application, she can easily store their contact details (Name, Company name, Cell Number, and additional notes) locally using an XML file. I used FXML for the GUI and used Java for backend, XML for handling the storage of data locally, and I was dabbling about with some CSS (hence the empty styles.css file I pushed with the project, I haven't as yet learnt any CSS and what I was trying to do was not really working out, maybe I'll return in the future to make a button blue or something :)).
